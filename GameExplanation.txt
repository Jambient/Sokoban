This is the explanation file for my assessment 2 game.

This game is a terminal version of the popular puzzle game from 1981 called "Sokoban". 
In this game, each puzzle consists of a map, boxes and goal points. Each box must be moved onto
its corresponding goal point. Boxes can only be pushed and cannot be pushed into spaces containing 
a wall or another box. This means you cannot push 2 or more boxes at the same time.

After playing the game for the first time, a file will be created with the name "UserData.txt". This
file stores the current unlocked level for the game. If you get stuck on a certain level, you can
edit this file and increment the number by one which will mark the level as completed.

Controls:
  W	  :  Move Up
  A	  :  Move Left
  S	  :  Move Down
  D	  :  Move Right
  R	  :  Restart Level
  F	  :  Fix Rendering **
  L	  :  Toggle Lighting
  ENTER	  :  Select Level

** If the terminal ever goes blank (usually after resizing the terminal), then use this control to fix the issue.

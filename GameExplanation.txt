This is the explanation file for my assessment 2 game.

This game is a console version of the popular puzzle game from 1981 called "Sokoban". 
In this game, each puzzle consists of a map, boxes and goal points. Each box must be moved onto
its corresponding goal point. Boxes can only be pushed and cannot be pushed into spaces containing a wall or another box.
This means you cannot push 2 or more boxes at the same time.

Controls:
  W	  :  Move Up
  A	  :  Move Left
  S	  :  Move Down
  D	  :  Move Right
  R	  :  Restart Level
  F	  :  Fix Rendering (IMPORTANT)
  ENTER	  :  Select Level
  RETURN  :  Exit Level

The control marked important is due to a rendering issue with the terminal console related to text wrapping. When the console is resized to a smaller size
than the current render, the whole terminal will become blank due to the ANSI modifiers breaking over the wrapping. I have added a bandaid fix which rebuilds
the current render when you press F.
